          I'm Jatin, 22 year old self taught fullstack web developer with 2
          years of experience. I specialize in building websites with
          user-friendly frontend and well optimized backend using React.js and
          Node.js.

        <div>
          I'm also a part of a WILP with HCL Tech. As experienced software
          engineer my role includes operational work and handling development
          requests.

          When I'm not working, I love kicking back and getting into web series
          and anime. Gaming is also a big part of my downtime â€“ there's nothing
          like diving into a good game. And to balance it all out, I enjoy
          staying active with workouts and playing sports like football. This
          helps me keep my head clear while I am working.
